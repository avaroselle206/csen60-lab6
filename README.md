“What’s the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs. Lab 6?”
Lab 4 was static, whereas Lab 6 was dynamic.
Static websites are made from individual files and appear the same to all users.
For dynamic websites, the server pulls information from one or more databases based on the user's request and creates the files that way.
